Refer to the paper for more information on the inner workings of
the parser, and a brief overview of Navajo Verb morphology. The

In order to make the Prolog parser accessible on the web, there
is some Perl code that connects running Prolog to the web server
through the CGI interface.  This code is located in the following
files:

    perl/Util.pm
    perl/Segmentizer.pm
    parse.s
  
The Prolog code is located here:
    prolog
