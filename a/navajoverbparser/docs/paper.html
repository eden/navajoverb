        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This paper will focus on Navajo verbs and finding ways 
        to algorithmically analyze them into their constituent 
        morphemes.  Morphemes are the minimum unit of meaning in 
        a language, and Navajo's verb morphology happens to be
        sufficiently complex to require more than the simple 
        analysis required of verbs in English.  For instance,
        a single, properly inflected Navajo verb can convey
        enough information to express what would require an
        entire sentence in English.  That is a Navajo sentence
        could consist entirely of a single verb that contains
        morphemes that describe the subject, the object, and
        the action of the sentence.</p>

        <p>Take the Navajo verb yishbe&#x0301;e&#x0301;zh.  It translates
        roughly into "I boil it."  The verb can be analyzed into
        the following structure.  An English translation of each
        morpheme also appears below.</p>

        <table class="template">
            <tr class="labels"><td>object</td><td>subject</td><td>classifier</td><td>stem</td></tr>
            <tr><td>(nothing)</td><td>sh</td><td>&#x026b;</td><td>be&#x0301;e&#x0301;zh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"it"</td><td>"I"</td><td></td><td>"boil"</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>We see that the underlying form (also known as the
        morphological form) of the verb shown
        above differs quite a bit from the given surface form
        yishbe&#x0301;e&#x0301;zh.  The reason for this is that
        Navajo has a list of rules that change how strings of
        consonants and vowels appear when they form a certain
        sequence.  These rules are called <em>phonological rules</em>.
        They connect the underlying form you see in the diagram
        with the surface form that is spoken and written by
        speakers of Navajo.</p>

        <p>The ultimate goal of this project then is to put together
        a system that accepts surface representations of Navajo verbs
        and provides the morphological parses (underlying forms) of these surface forms. In
        order to be able to separate morphemes from each other as represented
        in the surface form, the phonological processes that allowed us to arrive
        at the surface form, must be reversed.</p>

        <h2>The Navajo Verb</h2>
        <p>The Navajo verb relies exclusively on prefixes to convey
        subject, object and other information.  It all starts with the stem
        that describes the verb's basic meaning which is then modified by the
        prefixes that appear before it.  The prefixes undergo spelling (and spoken)
        changes depending on the vowels and consonants around it, we'll discuss
        this process more in the coming sections.</p>

        <h3>The Template</h3>
        <p>Faltz [1] divides the verb up into the following template.  Each place
        in the template can contain zero or more prefixes.  The first two
        prefix positions, outer and distributive plural, taken together are
        commonly referred to as the <em>Disjunct prefix</em>.  The two prefix
        positions following the disjunct prefix, object and inner, are known
        as the <em>Conjunct prefix</em>.</p>

        <table class="template" style="vertical-align:top;width:100%;">
            <tr class="labels">
                <td colspan="2" style="border-bottom:solid 2px black;">disjunct</td>
                <td colspan="2" style="border-bottom:solid 2px black;">conjunct</td>
                <td colspan="3"> </td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="font-size: xx-small;" id="templateExample">
                <td>outer</td>
                <td>distributive<br />plural</td>
                <td>object</td>
                <td>inner</td>
                <td>subject</td>
                <td>classifier</td>
                <td>stem</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>The stem is the main part of the verb syntactically, and, as shown above,
        appears at the very end of the verb template.   Semantically, it carries the
        main meaning describing the action or event of the verb.</p>

        <p>The inner and outer prefixes are known as lexical prefixes, and
        appear as part of the stem.  These prefixes carry meaning, and they
        may be attached to certain stems to change the meaning of that stem,
        however it is outside the scope of this document to describe each
        prefix and their meaning, so we simply take them for granted as something
        that comes along with a stem.</p>
        
        <p>The classifier is similar to the lexical prefixes in that it does
        not convey meaning by itself, and it appears as part of the verb stem.
        However, the classifier dictates the kinds of subject prefixes a
        particular verb might use.  They are analogous to Spanish's conjugation classes,
        except Navajo's classifiers are consonants.  There are four classifiers
        in Navajo: zero, plain-L, barred-L and d.</p>

        <p>The subject, object and distributive plural prefixes are known
        as <em>inflectional prefixes</em>.  They change form depending
        on the subject and object of the verb.  The subject describes to
        do-er of the action, while the object describes the person or thing
        to which the action is done.</p>

        <p>The distributive plural
        is an extra morpheme that is required by Navajo to distinguish
        between two kinds of plural: duo-plural and distributive plural.
        Without this prefix, the non-singular subject prefixes describe
        groups of exactly 2 people (duo-plural).  Adding this prefix to a verb changes
        this duo-plural prefix to allow for three or more people to
        be included as the subject of the verb.</p>

        <p>Navajo also has something called the fourth person.  English
        has no equivalent to fourth person, so it is difficult for the
        English speaker to understand how this construct is used.  Faltz [1]
        lists the following as examples of its use: a polite way to
        refer to someone who is present in your conversation, indicating
        an unspecified or indefinite subject, or a way of keeping track
        of two third person entities in a story (i.e. use 3rd person for one
        entity, and 4th for the other).</p>

        <h3>Segments</h3>
        <p>So, at this point, we know that a Navajo verb can be divided up
        into the template given in the previous section, but what actually
        appears in each of the template positions?  The answer is a list
        of segments.  A segment is a linguistic term for a speech sound.
        Segments are often represented by one or more letters taken from the
        International Phonetic Alphabet, but can be represented by clusters
        of alphabetic characters subject to spelling rules (as in any
        phonetically represented language).  The phonetic segment spelling
        we'll use for Navajo is based on Faltz [1] (which is in turn based on
        Young and Morgan [2]).</p>
        
        <p>Navajo segments are divided into 4 vowels and 30 consonants.  The
        four basic vowels can be modified during speech giving a total of
        32 possible combinations for vowels alone.  Some modifications that
        can occur are lengthening, nasalization, and applying a higher pitch
        to it than the rest of the vowel.  Vowels of different values may
        also be combined together to form diphthongs (i.e.
        <span class="code">ei</span> or <span class="code">ai</span>).
        These modifications change the
        spelling of the vowel and require us to make note of these changes.</p>

        <a name="#lexicon_and_verb_bases">
        <h3>Lexicon and Verb Bases</h3>
        <p>Now where do we get the actual list of segments to fill in each
        part of the template?  This comes from the Navajo speaker's mental
        lexicon.  This lexicon may be visualized as a list of something
        called <em>verb bases</em> that contain stem, prefix and classifier
        information.  It also contains <em>conjugation</em> and
        <em>transitivity</em> information.  These verb bases collect
        together all the information for a given verb that describes one
        particular action.</p>

        <p>The stem of a verb can change form depending on that verb's
        <em>mode</em>.  Navajo verb modes correspond to English verb tenses.  They give
        a time reference to the action or motion the verb describes.
        They come in 5 varieties: Imperfective (I), Perfective (P), Future (F),
        Iterative (R), and Optative (O).  There are actually seven total, but
        the other two modes re-use the stems from the F- and R-modes.
        Since stems change
        form based on mode, the verb base contains a list
        of forms for each mode that that verb will support.  This list of forms
        is known as the stem-set.</p>

        <p>With this in mind, we can view verb bases as having the
        following structure.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Stems:</b> The surface form of the stems for each mode, imperfective
            through optative.
            <li><b>Prefixes:</b> Lexical prefixes
            <ul>
                <li>Outer
                <li>Inner
                <li>Object
            </ul>
            <li><b>Transitivity:</b> Whether or not the verb is transitive.
            <li><b>Conjugation:</b> Determines which set of subject prefixes are used.
            <li><b>Classifier:</b> The classifier for the verb base.  Determines
            subject prefixes when forming verbs in the P-mode.
            <li><b>Aspect:</b> Information about how the action of the verb was conducted.
        </ul>

        <h3>Phonological Rules</h3>
        <p>After the prefixes and stem are selected and placed in the proper
        template position, phonological rules take over.  These rules change the
        spelling and pronunciation of a particular cluster of vowels and
        consonants depending on the clusters that come before and after
        it.  The place in which a cluster is found is called its
        <em>environment</em>.</p>

        <p>Faltz [1] divides
        these rules up based on the position in the template that rule deals
        with.  He lists Disjunct, Conjunct, Subject, and Structure rules.  Refer
        to his book for more details.  These rules, as we'll
        see in the following section, are the crux of
        the Navajo verb parsing strategy.  These rules change the form of the
        prefixes and morphological elements so that they are easier for a
        human speaker to pronounce, so in order to get to the root of the
        meaning of the verb, these rules need to be reversed in such a way
        that we obtain a list of the unchanged morphological elements from which
        we can determine meaning.</p>

        <h2>On to Parsing</h2>
        <p>Turning a Navajo verb from its surface form into its morphological
        parts seems to require two steps.  The first reverses the phonological
        rules described in the previous section, and the second assigns
        the morphological values to the separated prefixes that result from
        step one.</p>

        <p>After obtaining a list of prefixes and a stem, it is fairly
        straightforward to determine their morphology.  The prefixes (in their unchanged
        morphological forms) are subject to fairly strict rules regarding their
        placement.  So, as stated before, the most difficult problem to overcome
        was obtaining this list of unchanged morphemes.</p>

        <h3>Selecting the Technology</h3>
        <p>Initially, the project was going to be written in Perl or C# in an
        object-oriented style with the rules listed in the book being codified
        as procedures that operate on lists of segments.  It became clear during
        the initial design phase, however, that the rule interactions were
        going to be too complex to code directly.  It became clear that writing
        the solution in Prolog would be advantageous because of its ability
        to handle grammars natively.  Both Dr. Faltz and Dr. Davulcu (my
        readers) mentioned that if I were to implement it in an imperative
        language that I might be re-duplicating code that Prolog might
        handle for me already.</p>

        <p>I began writing the project in Prolog and after spending a few
        days in it, it became very clear that Prolog would be preferable
        to something like C# or Perl.</p>

        <p>The next step was designing the interface between the Prolog
        system and the user.  I decided that a web based application would
        be advantageous here since one my readers is not currently in
        Arizona.  She would be able to access the system from the Internet.
        It was fairly trivial to write a Perl-based interface between the
        web server and Prolog.</p>

        <h3>Reverse Phonology</h3>
        <p>The rules described in Appendix A of Faltz 1998 offer a comprehensive
        list of phonological rules that aid in the formation of proper Navajo
        verbs.  As described before, they are divided into four sections
        depending on which part of the template they operate: Disjunct,
        Conjunct, Subject and Structure.</p>

        <p>The main part of the project was writing Prolog rules for definite
        clause grammars (DCG) that had the effect of reversing these phonological rules.
        This was no easy task, however, since each rule depended on having
        some information about the verb's morphology before we even had
        that information (the rules were written with synthesis in mind,
        not analysis).  Also, some rules depended on others to be applied
        in a certain order.</p>
        
        <p>To cope with this, the reversal rules were written such that each
        rule was implemented as its own stand-alone DCG that generated
        <em>possible</em> underlying forms based on the given list of segments.
        Each of these rules was put into a list, and the initially given
        surface form would be passed to the first rule on the list.  This rule
        would generate possibly underlying forms adding to the list of total
        possibly underlying forms.  Each rule would be applied in turn to this
        list (possibly generating more forms to add to the list) until all
        the rules are exhausted.  The order that the rules appear in the rule
        list depends on the interaction required by certain rules.</p>

        <p>After all the rules are applied, the result is a long list of all
        possible underlying forms of the given surface form.  This list
        is then narrowed down to one or more valid form as dictated by morphology
        constraints (also implemented as a DCG).  Note, two or more valid forms
        may be found if the verb has an ambiguous surface form.  This sometimes
        happens in Navajo.</p>

        <h3>Representing the Lexicon</h3>
        <p>The verb base list was written as an XML document with each of the
        elements described above as tags.  XML was chosen in the hopes that
        it may be useful for others to port into their Navajo-based system.
        My system takes the XML document and converts them into a list of
        Prolog predicates.</p>

        <p>The XML schema is follows the structure listed in the
        <a href="#lexicon_and_verb_bases">Lexicon and Verb Bases</a> section.
        Here is a typical entry for a verb base:
        </p>

        <pre style="border: solid 1px black;margin:0;padding:0.5em 1em;" class="code">
&lt;VerbBase&gt;
    &lt;StemSet&gt;
        &lt;I&gt;ne&#x0301;e&#x0301;h&lt;/I&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;na'&lt;/P&gt;
        &lt;F&gt;nah&lt;/F&gt;
        &lt;R&gt;nah&lt;/R&gt;
        &lt;O&gt;ne&#x0301;e&#x0301;h&lt;/O&gt;
    &lt;/StemSet&gt;
    &lt;Gloss&gt;
        &lt;English&gt;be crawling&lt;/English&gt;
    &lt;/Gloss&gt;
    &lt;Aspect&gt;momentaneous&lt;/Aspect&gt;
    &lt;Classifier&gt;d&lt;/Classifier&gt;
    &lt;Prefix&gt;
        &lt;Inner&gt;d&lt;/Inner&gt;
    &lt;/Prefix&gt;
    &lt;Conjugation&gt;lv&lt;/Conjugation&gt;
    &lt;Transitivity&gt;transitive&lt;/Transitivity&gt;
&lt;/VerbBase&gt;
        </pre>

        <h3>Segments and Unicode</h3>
        <p>The segments described in the Navajo verb section are
        divided into consonants and vowels.  These segments are represented at the
        user interface by Unicode and as sequences of alphabetic characters in the
        Prolog system.</p>

        <p>There are three special characters that cannot be directly represented by
        ASCII alphabetic characters, these are the barred-l (&#x026b;), the high tone
        diacritic mark (o&#x0301;) and the nasal diacritic mark (o&#x0345;).  Unicode
        allows the combination of these two diacritic marks as long as the nasal appears
        after the high-tone mark.  The user interface is a web browser, so it can
        display these characters correctly, but because the version of Prolog I
        used does not support Unicode directly,
        these characters must be converted to plain ASCII characters and back.
        The following mapping was used to convert the user interface representation
        to a version that can be manipulated by Prolog.</p>

        <div class="outfigure">
            <table>
                <tr><th>Segment/Feature</th><th>ASCII</th></tr>
                <tr><td>barred-l</td><td class="code">lB</td></tr>
                <tr><td>high-tone</td><td class="code">H</td></tr>
                <tr><td>nasal</td><td class="code">N</td></tr>
                <tr><td>high-tone and nasal</td><td class="code">HN</td></tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>Now, in order to take advantage of discrete clause grammars that Prolog
        allows us to use, we need to represent the surface form as a list of segments.
        This means we need a way to make sure that sequences of ASCII characters
        get separated into the proper segments.</p>

        <p>To illustrate, take the verb naashne&#x0301; which means "I play" and has
        a high-tone diacritic mark on the last vowel.  This can be represented by
        <span class="code">naashneH</span> in ASCII.  We want to make sure that it
        gets turned into a list that looks like: <span class="code">[n, aa, sh, n, eH]</span>,
        <em>not</em> something like <span class="code">[n, aa, s, h, n, eH]</span>.  In Navajo,
        <span class="code">sh</span> is a single consonant, so taking it as
        two consonants <span class="code">s,h</span> is incorrect.  Incidentally, if one
        needs to represent two consonants s and h following each other, the h turns to an x
        yielding "sx".</p>

        <p>How does this get resolved?  The answer is to match the
        beginning of the inputted surface form with a list of segments sorted
        in order of longest to shortest and matching each with
        the beginning of the inputted surface until a match is found.
        After a segment is found, we copy that into our list of segments,
        and remove that sequence of characters from the beginning of the
        string.  This is repeated until no more characters are left in the
        input string.  If at any time during the matching, the list is
        exhausted, and no matches were found, we know the input contains
        some characters that do not belong in the Navajo verb spelling.
        </p>

        <p>Checking the longest segments first ensures that we always
        obtain the proper segments because it is the longer consonant
        clusters that we do not want to confuse with the shorter clusters.
        Thus, matching and removing the longer clusters first disallows
        the shorter ones to erroneously match on subsequent iterations of
        the main loop.</p>

        <h3>Representing Morphology</h3>
        <p>It is easy to represent data in Prolog as something called a
        <em>predicate</em> which consist of a <em>head</em> followed by
        a list of arguments.  These arguments can either be an <em>atom</em>,
        another predicate or a list of predicates and atoms.
        An atom is simply a word or token containing
        only alphanumeric characters.  Here is an example of a Prolog
        predicate:</p>

        <p class="code">head(atom, head2(atom2), atom3)</p>

        <p>With this in mind, we can then see that the easiest way to
        represent the morphology of a parsed Navajo verb is something
        approximating the template given in previous section.</p>
        
        <p>
        <pre style="border: solid 1px black;margin:0;padding:0.5em 1em;" class="code">
template(
    disjunct(outer(<em>outer</em>),
             distpl(<em>da or empty</em>)),
    conjunct(object(<em>object</em>),
             inner(<em>inner</em>)),
    subject(<em>subject</em>),
    classifier(<em>classifier</em>),
    stem(<em>stem</em>)
)</pre>
        Figure 1. Template as a Prolog predicate.
        </p>

        <p>Thus, the result of a parse looks something similar to Figure 1.</p>

        <h3>Putting it Together</h3>
        <p>At this point, we have the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A way to represent the lexicon.
            <li>A way to convert from a human readable spelling of a Navajo verb to
                an internal representation that can be manipulated by Prolog.
            <li>A way to represent the morphological form.
            <li>An abstraction between surface, phonological and morphological forms.
            <li>A user interface.
        </ul>

        <p>So the top level diagram of this system looks something like this:</p>

        <p class="outfigure">
        <img src="images/toplevel.png" class="figure">
            Figure 2. Top-level diagram of the parsing system.</p>

        <p>The user interface produces the list of segments described in the
        preceding section.  The parser takes this list, applies phonological
        rules (represented as DCGs).  The list of possible underlying
        phonological forms is then matched against morphology rules producing
        a template of the form given in figure 1.  This template is then
        converted to HTML for the user's consumption.  Refer to figure 3 for
        a breakdown of this process.</p>

        <p>Figure 4 shows an example of a verb travelling through this
        process.  The actual forms are simplified from what really is
        used in the system, but the idea comes across.</p>

        <h3>Limitations and Future Directions</h3>

        <p>As with any natural language, forms used in a language
        don't always follow the rules.  Navajo is no exception, and
        as such, we have focused the parser to work on a limited subset
        of the Navajo verb.  This subset includes limiting the supported
        modes to Imperfective, Perfective and Future.  Some things
        that are not supported include the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Neuter verbs</li>
            <li>Irregular verbs</li>
            <li>Modes other than I-, P- and F-mode.</li>
            <li>Seriative prefix</li>
            <li>Passive, reciprocal, and reflexive constructions</li>
            <li>Perfective <b>da</b>-shift</li>
            <li>Outer object prefixes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Obviously, the next step for improvement of this parser is
        to add these features.</p>

        <p>There are some forms surface level forms that map to multiple
        underlying morphology templates.  Sometimes this is valid, and it
        is known that these forms are ambiguous.  The problem, however,
        is that in a few cases where the system shows two or more templates,
        the forms entered are not supposed to be ambiguous.</p>

        <p>This problem stems from the phonology reversing rules.  They
        were written to be as general as possible, and as a result, they
        sometimes produce underlying forms that may be interpreted in
        more than one way.  To curb this problem, I have the rules produce
        guesses on what certain parts of the verb mean at the time that
        rule sees it.  This limits the number of erroneous templates, but
        does not eliminate them.  A refinement of this system would decrease
        the number of incorrectly identified ambiguous parses.</p> 

        <p>Also, the parser is limited to parsing verbs it knows
        about that is only the verbs that come from the verb bases
        in the verb base lexicon can be parsed correctly.  This is
        not so much a limitation as inherent to the design of the
        project.  A possible goal for the future would be to have it
        automatically determine the stem, mode, aspect and classifier
        without reference to a lexicon.  This, however, may be a
        diffcult prospect.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Navajo verb parser takes a Navajo verb in its fully inflected
        form and maps it to one or more templates that describe its morphology.
        This mapping takes place after reversing phonological rules required
        by the Navajo language.  These rules along with the morphology matching
        are implemented in Prolog.  The interface between the user and the
        Prolog subsystem is implemented with Perl through a web server.</p>
